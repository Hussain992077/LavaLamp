# Description of the project
this is about a cool visual Lava Lamp that play around with some interesting graphical rendering techniques
since this might be required some  shader code im going to use unity to create it.
so it is a lava lamp which contains a cap, the glass area and the base. there is some kind of a heating oil element on the bottom and the bolus inside the glass area. these also have viscosity and the fact that these bolus can merge toghether. so im going to make the scene on unity and using shader to move the bolus.   




# Instructions for use

In order to use this project you have to first have a suitable version of unity installed alongside with the suitable unity packages and pipelines to run the project optimally. Once you have them installed you are now ready to run the game in unity and if you have a oculus VR headset, you can run it on that too. The lava lamp will make the lava rotate around when ran.

# What I am most proud of in the assignmen

I am most proud of of the fact that I have learnt some new skills with creating a beautiful and functional project. I am proud of my learning across the duration of building the project and that I can now showcase my lava lamp to anyone I want to impress with my unity skills. I am super proud of what I achieved in this project and all the new skills will carry over to future projects.
